#Weather Dashboard


As a traveler
I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
so that I can plan a trip accordingly


Features:
<br/>
Allows the user to see current position weather data
<br/>
User can search for cities which are then saved to a list which can be accessed upon 
reloading the page via local storage
<br/>
Upon selection of a city, current weather data is displayed, along with a 5 day forecast
of weather data at 3PM local time.

Technologies Used:
<br/>
Open Weather API
<br/>
jQuery
<br/>
Javascript
<br/>
HTML
<br/>
CSS
<br/>


Instructions:
<br/>
A prompt will appear upon page load asking for permission to access the users location
<br/>
	If no is chosen, local weather will not be displayed
	<br/>
	If this is allowed, local weather will load (this may take a moment)
	<br/>
	
User then can add cities to the list on the right of the page using the input and submit
buttons, which can then be clicked to retrieve the weather data and forecast.
<br/>
